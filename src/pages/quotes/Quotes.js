        Mathematics are the result of mysterious powers which no one
        understands, and which the unconscious recognition of beauty must play
        an important part. Out of an infinity of designs a mathematician chooses
        one pattern for beauty’s sake and pulls it down to earth. — Marston
        Morse.
